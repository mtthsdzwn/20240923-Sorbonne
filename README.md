# Slides for presentation on Open Research Information
I use this repository to publish the slides I used for my presentation on the use of open research information. I presented at at Sorbonne University on September 2024 at a meeting for signatories of the [Barcelona Declaration](https://barcelona-declaration.org/) on open research information. 

I used [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) to design the slides. The source code is available in this repository, the final slides are [here](https://mtthsdzwn.github.io/20240923-Sorbonne/).
